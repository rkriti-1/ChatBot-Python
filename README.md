# ChatBot-Python

A chatbot is a computer software that allows people to communicate with it using natural language and artificial intelligence methods like NLP (natural language processing), which makes the chatbot more dependable and interactive.

The goal of this project is to create a general purpose chatbot that can respond to questions on sports, literature, music, and other topics. I've made an effort to create a universal bot that can talk about almost anything.
